Build responsive page layouts using the widgets you know and love using this simple drag and drop page builder.

== Description ==

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/59561067]

Page Builder 2.0 is coming. Read our [announcement post](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder-2-changes-everything/) for more on what you can expect from this update.

WordPress has evolved into a fully functional CMS. Page Builder (previously called Panels) completes the transition by giving you a way to create responsive column layouts using the widgets you know and love.

= Use Your Widgets =

You know widgets. They're the things you add to your sidebars. Page Builder makes all your widgets even more useful by turning them into the building blocks of your pages.

We've included a few useful widgets, but it works with a lot of other widgets and plugins out there.

= Works with Most Themes =

Page Builder works with most well made themes. The only requirement is that your theme supports pages. And if your theme is responsive, change a few settings and boom, your layouts will work with your theme and collapse into a single column on mobile devices.

There are loads free and premium themes that work with the Page Builder, we have our own collection of [free themes](https://siteorigin.com/) if you'd like to use one of ours.

Page Builder [Documentation](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/documentation/) is available on SiteOrigin and we offer free support on our [support forum](http://siteorigin.com/threads/plugin-page-builder/). If you're having strange issues, try following [this guide](http://siteorigin.com/troubleshooting/identifying-plugin-conflicts/).

= Bundled Widgets =

To get you started, we've include a few widgets:

* Gallery widget for inserting image galleries.
* Image widget for inserting standard images.
* Self hosted video widget for embedding your own videos.
* Post Loop to display a list of posts. This requires that your theme supports it.

As well as some essential page elements widgets:

* Button
* Call to Action
* List
* Price Box
* Animated Image
* Testimonial

= 3rd Party Widgets =

Most standard widgets work with Page Builder, but here are some of our favorites.

* [SiteOrigin Widget Bundle](http://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/) for growing collection of widgets like buttons, price tables and images.
* [Black Studio TinyMCE](http://wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/) for a visual content editing widget.
* [Meta Slider](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider/) for a responsive slider widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and install Page Builder in the same way you'd install any other plugin.
2. Read the [usage documentation](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder/documentation/) on SiteOrigin.

== Screenshots ==

1. The page builder interface.
2. Adding a new widget. This includes a live search filter to help you keep control if you have a lot of widgets.
3. Editing a widget's settings.
4. Easily undo mistakes.

== Documentation ==

[Documentation](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder/documentation/) is available on SiteOrigin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I move a site created with Page Builder from one server to another? =

We recommend the [duplicator plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/). We've tested it in several instances and it always works well with Page Builder data.

= Can I bundle Page Builder with my theme? =

Yes, provided your theme is licensed under GPL or a compatible license. If you're publishing your theme on ThemeForest, you must select the GPL license instead of their regular license.

Page Builder is actively developed and updated, so generally I'd recommend that you have your users install the actual plugin so they can receive updates. You can try [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/).

= Will plugin X work with Page Builder? =

I've tried to ensure that Page Builder is compatible with most plugin widgets. It's best to just download Page Builder and test for yourself.
